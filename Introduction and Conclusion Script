Introduction:

Background:
For this project, we attempted to look for a way to predict stock prices using news article titles. The article titles are taken 
are taken from the New York Times; we then try and use theres titles to help predict the Dow Jones Industrial Avergae(DIJA) index prices
which was taken from Yahoo Finance. The range of the data spans a decade from 2007 - 2016 inclusive. We Hypothesize that positive news should lead 
to an increase in the DIJA prices while negative news should lower the DIJA prices.

Methods used and why:
To help us predict the prices, we used a number of machine learning algorithms from regressions to random forest and ending with neural 
network-based algorithm, multilayer perceptron (MLP).
The prediction process is a time-series issue and very similar to linear regression. From the regression family we selected logistics regression
and ensemble algorithm RandomForestRegressor. With both these algorithms found lacking we implemented the neural network-based algorithm MLP.


The data is split between testing and training data. The training data is then fed into the algorithm
before the testing data is tested. The methods are then evaluated to see how accurate they are, 
this is done through finding the r^2 coefficient value as well as simply examining a visual output.
The r^2 value have it's own built-in function which we used to find the value while for the visual output
we graphed the actual values contrasted to the predicted values to see how close the predictions were.

Some other ways to help improve the accuracy of the estimated include smoothing and alignment. 
Alignment:
  - Take a contant value and add that onto the predicted values to ensure that it is aligned with
    the actual values
  - It is the difference between the average estimated prices and the real prices over a certain
    time range.
Smoothing:
  - Used Exponentially Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) which has a built-in API



Conclusion:
Both regression algorithms were found lacking even with the help of smoothing and alignment they were not very accurate in their estimates. 
They were not following the path of the actual data in their estimates therefore are unable to accurately and consistently predict stock index
prices. 
In the end MLP was the most effective approach especially when combined with cross-validation do find the best variable levels.
Looking at the graph, this method method's estimations are the closest and most similar to the real index prices therefore it can 
provide accurate estimates given article titles.
