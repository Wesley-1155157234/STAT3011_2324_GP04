Introduction:
Background:
articles are from NYT
index prices is the Dow Jones from Yahoo
ranges 10 years 2007-2016
articles are put into 


Methods used and why:
logistics regression: simplest straighfowards regression algorithm with many built-in functions
random forest: also relatively simple to use and isn't heavily affected by outliers or missing values
MLP: more complicated and intensive algorithm but should be the most accurate. Most simple but also felxible neural-network algorithm

accuracy and extra stuff:
Data is split - for cross validation and other tests
  - used K-fold cross-validations
Found r^2 and MSE values
Relied on visual graphic comparisons


Some other ways to help improve the accuracy of the estimated include smoothing and alignment. 
Alignment:
  - Take a contant value and add that onto the predicted values to ensure that it is aligned with
    the actual values
  - It is the difference between the average estimated prices and the real prices over a certain
    time range.
Smoothing:
  - Used Exponentially Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) which has a built-in API


For the dates part:
the original method used in the book didn't have the dates involved at all, not using any time factor, we did a basic method of putting the days into an integer from 1-365
while this had an effect, the overall accuracy of the model didn't not improve - there are likely better options which we could try next time 
to imporve our estimations


Conclusion:
MLP is best algorithm out of the three we tried. This was determine through comparing the r^2 coefficient number
however although it was the most accurate out of the three algorithms which we used, it is still quite unequiped for predictions
  - this is clear through looking visually at the graphs that was produced

both regressions are very lacking and not not accurate in its estimates at all even after smoothing and alignment
Implemented cross validation to help find good values to use for the different variables in the MLP
the MLP was the most effective approach although even that was very inaccurate in it's estimates and if you were actually estimating the stock and 
using real money, would not recommend following the predictions of the MLP algorithm..
why?
  - possibly the lack of normality in the data ensured that the regression models wouldn't work well
  - overfitting was also a problem with the regressive algorithms although they would be so inaccurate the overfitting is no longer a major issue
  - for the MLP one of the biggest flaws with the process that we implemented is that it does not take into account the time factor, instead we 
    kept only the articles as the main changing variable
    
MLP is a Feedfoward Neural Network(FNN), the simplest types of neural network models. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) however may have been a 
better option albeit more complicated to program as unlike FNN where it is a one direction flow of information, input --> output, in RNNs they 
have directed cycles allowing the persistence of data very fitting for time-series 
problem.  While forecasting with RNN has flaws they are best fitting for time-series problems. In conclusion the best solution would actually be a comination
of the two algorithms in a hybrid 


News articles not very good at predicting stock prices
