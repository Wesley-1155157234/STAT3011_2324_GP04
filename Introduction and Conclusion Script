Introduction:
Background:
articles are from NYT
index prices is the Dow Jones from Yahoo
ranges 10 years 2007-2016
articles are put into 


Methods used and why:
logistics regression: simplest straighfowards regression algorithm with many built-in functions
random forest: also relatively simple to use and isn't heavily affected by outliers or missing values
MLP: more complicated and intensive algorithm but should be the most accurate. Most simple but also felxible neural-network algorithm

accuracy and extra stuff:
Data is split - for cross validation and other tests
  - used K-fold cross-validations
Found r^2 and MSE values
Relied on visual graphic comparisons


Some other ways to help improve the accuracy of the estimated include smoothing and alignment. 
Alignment:
  - Take a contant value and add that onto the predicted values to ensure that it is aligned with
    the actual values
  - It is the difference between the average estimated prices and the real prices over a certain
    time range.
Smoothing:
  - Used Exponentially Weighted Moving Average(EWMA) which has a built-in API



Conclusion:
MLP is best algorithm out of the three we tried. This was determine through comparing the r^2 coefficient number
however although it was the most accurate out of the three algorithms which we used, it is still quite unequiped for predictions
  - this is clear through looking visually at the graphs that was produced


Both regression algorithms were found lacking even with the help of smoothing and alignment they were not very accurate in their estimates. 
They were not following the path of the actual data in their estimates therefore are unable to accurately and consistently predict stock index
prices. 
In the end MLP was the most effective approach especially when combined with cross-validation do find the best variable levels.
Looking at the graph, this method method's estimations are the closest and most similar to the real index prices therefore it can 
provide accurate estimates given article titles. 
The Two regression algorithms are qutie straightwardard and simple to use with readily available built in functions but due to the data
not being normalized as well some overfitting issues they were found lacking

MLP is best at estimations in the algorithms that we tried but it has it's own issues. 
There are many types of artificial neural network algorithms for a variety of types of problems but MLP is a Feedfoward Neural Network(FNN), the simplest
types of neural network models. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) however may have been a better option albeit more complicated to program as unlike FNN where
it is a one direction flow of information, input --> output, in RNNs they have directed cycles allowing the persistence of data very fitting for time-series 
problem.  While forecasting with RNN has flaws they are best fitting for time-series problems. In conclusion the best solution would actually be a comination
of the two algorithms in a hybrid 

Dealing with stocks predictions over long periods of time and especially with economic markets having a lag in response time, this persistence of
information overtime may provide even more accurate estimations. With the MLP algorithm, it actually doesn't take into account time and dates, it does not take
into account the information about yesterday or the day before when determining the estimated price of today which lowers the accuracy of the estimations. 
In MLPs themselves, one of the most important aspect are the layers, they determine the efficiency and scale of the model. The main aspects that we could have 
changed in the layers, are the number of layers for each category(input, hidden and output) as well as the weight given. The layer variables were determined through
cross-validation to find the most optimal/accurate values. 

News articles not very good at predicting stock prices
