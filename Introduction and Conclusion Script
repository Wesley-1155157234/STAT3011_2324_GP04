Introduction:

Background:
For this project, we attempted to look for a way to predict stock prices using news article titles. The article titles are taken 
are taken from the New York Times; we then try and use theres titles to help predict the Dow Jones Industrial Avergae(DIJA) index prices
which was taken from Yahoo Finance. The range of the data spans a decade from 2007 - 2016 inclusive. We Hypothesize that positive news should lead 
to an increase in the DIJA prices while negative news should lower the DIJA prices.

Methods used and why:
To help us predict the prices, we used a number of machine learning algorithms from regressions to random forest and ending with neural 
network-based algorithm, multilayer perceptron (MLP). 
We started off with simple regressions because they are the most straightforward and simple methods. However with the simpleness they also are one 
of the least accurate in it's predictions.
